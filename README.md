## ‚ùì What is a CTF?

A **Capture The Flag (CTF)** is a hands-on cybersecurity game. Players solve puzzles, find vulnerabilities, or analyze evidence to uncover a secret text called a **flag** (e.g., `FLAG{you_found_me}`). CTFs simulate real-world security problems in a safe, legal environment.

---

## üéÆ How CTFs are Played

* **Challenges:** Self-contained tasks (web, crypto, forensics, OSINT, reverse engineering, etc.).
* **Flags:** Unique strings you submit to score points.
* **Scoring:** Harder tasks = more points; leaderboards track progress.
* **Solo or Teams:** Play alone or collaborate.
* **Timeboxed Events:** Ranges from 1‚Äì48 hours or ongoing practice labs.
* **Platforms:** We host with **Simulation Labs** (no‚Äëcode friendly, reliable infra).

---

## üåç Why CTFs Matter (for Everyone)

* **Beginners/Students:** Learn by doing; build confidence & curiosity.
* **Professionals/Employees:** Practice incident response, policy-in-action, and secure habits.
* **Organizations/Enterprises:** Team resilience, skills assessment, and culture-building.
* **Career Growth:** Build a portfolio with write-ups & badges; showcase practical skills.
* **Community:** Inclusive, collaborative learning ‚Äî not gatekept.

---

## üß© Game Modes & Categories

* **Jeopardy Style:** Solve independent puzzles; submit flags.
* **Attack/Defense:** Teams defend their service while attacking others (advanced).
* **Awareness Tracks:** Phishing, password strength, cyber hygiene, OSINT basics.
* **Applied Tracks:** Web vulns, forensics, reverse engineering, crypto, cloud.
